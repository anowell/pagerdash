pagerdash
========

A pagerduty dashboard, for viewing pagerduty alerts in a different way. In particular, the current
implementation focuses on visualizing how much pagerduty interrupts us. The hope is to refactor the metadash
project such that this can feel like a natural extension of metadash - ideally this would become metadash-pagerduty at some point.

Here's a sample screenshot, but be warned, much of the functionality is incomplete (i.e. the entire top navbar)

setup
=====

Create config.js in the root directory. For better or worse, this is currently an exported js object.

    (function(exports){

        'use strict';
        exports.access = {
            authToken: "<PAGERDUTY_AUTHTOKEN>",
            subdomain: "<PAGERDUTY_SUBDOMAIN>"
        };

        exports.links = {
            weekly : [
                {
                    label: 'All Engineering',
                    query: '?service=<SERVICEID1>|<SERVICEID2>|<SERVICEID3>'
                },
                {
                    label: 'Engineering Subset',
                    query: '?service=<SERVICEID1>'
                },
                {
                    label: 'Non Engineering',
                    query: '?service=<SERVICEID4>'
                },
                {
                    label: 'Everything',
                    query: ''
                }
            ]
        }

    })(typeof exports === 'undefined'? this.pagerduty={} : exports);


Test the config with grunt dev server:

    npm install grunt-cli -g
    npm install bower -g
    npm install
    bower install
    grunt server

Or to build a production release (not yet tested) to the dist folder:

    grunt build


For production, drop the config.js into the dist directory,
and configure a webserver to serve it statically and proxy api requests with the pagerduty auth token.

I'll add a sample nginx config when I get to that point.
